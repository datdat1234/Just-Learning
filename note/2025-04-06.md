# Kotlin Tutorial

- About Kotlin: Kotlin is a modern programming language that helps developers be more productive. For example, Kotlin allows you to be more concise and write fewer lines of code for the same functionality compared to other programming languages. Apps that are built with Kotlin are also less likely to crash, resulting in a more stable and robust app for users. Essentially, with Kotlin, you can write better Android apps in a shorter amount of time. As a result, Kotlin is gaining momentum in the industry and is the language that the majority of professional Android developers use.

- Warning: Unlike in some languages, such as Java, where a function can change the value passed into a parameter, parameters in Kotlin are immutable. You cannot reassign the value of a parameter from within the function body.

# About Android Studio

- Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development, built and distributed by Google. An IDE contains tools that enable software developers to design, build, run, and test software, in this case, apps for the Android platform. Android Studio uses IntelliJ IDEA as its foundation and includes the Android plugin pre-installed along with some modifications specifically for the Android platform.

- Find project files
   - In Android Studio, take a look at the Project tab. The Project tab shows the files and folders of your project. When you were setting up your project the package name was com.example.greetingcard. You can see that package right here in the Project tab. A package is basically a folder where code is located. Android Studio organizes the project in a directory structure made up of a set of packages.
   - If necessary, select Android from the drop-down menu in the Project tab.
   - Select Project Source Files from the drop-down menu. You can now browse the files in the same way as in any file browser.
   - Select Android again to switch back to the previous view. You use the Android view for this course. If your file structure ever looks strange, check to make sure you're still in Android view.

- The onCreate() function is the entry point to this Android app and calls other functions to build the user interface. In Kotlin programs, the main() function is the entry point/starting point of execution. In Android apps, the onCreate() function fills that role.

- The setContent() function within the onCreate() function is used to define your layout through composable functions. All functions marked with the @Composable annotation can be called from the setContent() function or from other Composable functions. The annotation tells the Kotlin compiler that this function is used by Jetpack Compose to generate the UI.

- You've learned about functions before, but there are a few differences with composable functions.
   - You add the @Composable annotation before the function.
   - @Composable function names are capitalized.
   - @Composable functions can't return anything.

- The GreetingPreview() function is a cool feature that lets you see what your composable looks like without having to build your entire app. To enable a preview of a composable, annotate with @Composable and @Preview. The @Preview annotation tells Android Studio that this composable should be shown in the design view of this file.

- A Modifier is used to augment or decorate a composable. One modifier you can use is the padding modifier, which adds space around the element (in this case, adding space around the text). This is accomplished by using the Modifier.padding() function. Every composable should have an optional parameter of the type Modifier. This should be the first optional parameter.

- If you installed Android Studio on Windows via __Preferences > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK__, you must install a USB device driver before you can run your app on a physical device.

# Build a basic layout

- Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building Android UIs. Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin capabilities. With Compose, you can build your UI by defining a set of functions, called composable functions, that take in data and describe UI elements.

- The Composable function is annotated with the @Composable annotation. All composable functions must have this annotation. This annotation informs the Compose compiler that this function is intended to convert data into UI. As a reminder, a compiler is a special program that takes the code you wrote, looks at it line by line, and translates it into something the computer can understand (machine language).

- __Composable function names__: The compose function that returns nothing and bears the @Composable annotation MUST be named using Pascal case. Pascal case refers to a naming convention in which the first letter of each word in a compound word is capitalized. The difference between Pascal case and camel case is that all words in Pascal case are capitalized. In camel case, the first word can be in either case.

- You should always separate app resources, such as images and strings, from your code so that you can maintain them independently. At runtime, Android uses the appropriate resource based on the current configuration. For example, you might want to provide a different UI layout based on the screen size or different strings based on the language setting.

- Jetpack Compose can access the resources defined in your Android project. Resources can be accessed with resource IDs that are generated in your project's R class.
