# Just-Learning
This repository is for documenting my learning process

1. Chinese branch <br />
I will commit daily lessons from my Chinese studies to this branch. My goal is to achieve HSK6 by June 2025.

2. Java/OCA branch <br />
This branch will contain my basic Java lessons based on the OCA Java SE 8 Programmer book. I aim to obtain the OCA certification by June 2025.

2. VueJS <br />
In this branch, I will commit lessons from the [Vue.js documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html). This is part of my effort to enhance my skills in using Vue.js for project development.
