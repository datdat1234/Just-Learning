19. A, G. Options B and C don’t compile because the constructor name must match the classname. Since Java is case sensitive, these don’t match. Options D, E, and F all compile and provide one user-defined constructor. Since a constructor is coded, a default constructor isn’t supplied. Option G defines a method, but not a constructor. Option A does not define a constructor, either. Since no constructor is coded, a default constructor is provided for options A and G.
20. E
21. C. Within the constructor numSpots refers to the constructor parameter. The instance variable is hidden because they have the same name. this.numSpots tells Java to use the instance variable. In the main() method, numSpots refers to the instance variable. Option A sets the constructor parameter to itself, leaving the instance variable as 0. Option B sets the constructor parameter to the value of the instance variable, making them both 0. Option C is correct, setting the instance variable to the value of the constructor parameter. Options D and E do not compile.
