# Working with Dates and Times

- As with an ArrayList, you need an import statement to work with the date and time classes. Most of them are in the java.time package. To use it, add this import to your program:
```
import java.time.*; // import time classes
```

# Creating Dates and Times

- When working with dates and times, the first thing to do is decide how much information you need. The exam gives you three choices:
   - __LocalDate__: Contains just a date—no time and no time zone. A good example of LocalDate is your birthday this year. It is your birthday for a full day regardless of what time it is.
   - __LocalTime__: Contains just a time—no date and no time zone. A good example of LocalTime is midnight. It is midnight at the same time every day.
   - __LocalDateTime__: Contains both a date and time but no time zone. A good example of LocalDateTime is “the stroke of midnight on New Year’s.” Midnight on January 2 isn’t nearly as special, and clearly an hour after midnight isn’t as special either.

- Oracle recommends avoiding time zones unless you really need them. Try to act as if everyone is in the same time zone when you can. If you do need to communicate across time zones, ZonedDateTime handles them.
```
System.out.println(LocalDate.now());
System.out.println(LocalTime.now());
System.out.println(LocalDateTime.now());
```

- Each of the three classes has a static method called now() that gives the current date and time. Your output is going to depend on what date/time you run it and where you live. The authors live in the United States, making the output look like the following when run on January 20 at 12:45 p.m.:
```
2015-01-20
12:45:18.401
2015-01-20T12:45:18.401
```

- The key is to notice the type of information in the output. The first one contains only a date and no time. The second contains only a time and no date. This time displays hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds. The third contains both date and time. Java uses T to separate the date and time when converting LocalDateTime to a String.

- __Wait—I Don’t Live in the United States__: The exam recognizes that exam takers live all over the world and will not ask you about the details of United States date and time formats.

- In the United States, the month is written before the date. The exam won’t ask you about the difference between 02/03/2015 and 03/02/2015. That would be mean and not internationally friendly, and it would be testing your knowledge of United States dates rather than your knowledge of Java. That said, our examples do use United States date and time formats as will the questions on the exam. Just remember that the month comes before the date. Also, Java tends to use a 24-hour clock even though the United States uses a 12-hour clock with a.m./p.m.

- Now that you know how to create the current date and time, let’s look at other specific dates and times. To begin, let’s create just a date with no time. Both of these examples create the same date:
```
LocalDate date1 = LocalDate.of(2015, Month.JANUARY, 20);
LocalDate date2 = LocalDate.of(2015, 1, 20);
```

- Both pass in the year, month, and date. Although it is good to use the Month constants (to make the code easier to read), you can pass the int number of the month directly. Just use the number of the month the same way you would if you were writing the date in real life.
```
public static LocalDate of(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth)
public static LocalDate of(int year, Month month, int dayOfMonth)
```

- Up to now, we’ve been like a broken record telling you that Java counts starting with 0. Well, months are an exception. For months in the new date and time methods, Java counts starting from 1 like we human beings do.

- When creating a time, you can choose how detailed you want to be. You can specify just the hour and minute, or you can add the number of seconds. You can even add nanoseconds if you want to be very precise. (A nanosecond is a billionth of a second—you probably won’t need to be that specific.)
```
LocalTime time1 = LocalTime.of(6, 15); // hour and minute
LocalTime time2 = LocalTime.of(6, 15, 30); // + seconds
LocalTime time3 = LocalTime.of(6, 15, 30, 200); // + nanoseconds
```

- These three times are all different but within a minute of each other. The method signatures are as follows:
```
public static LocalTime of(int hour, int minute)
public static LocalTime of(int hour, int minute, int second)
public static LocalTime of(int hour, int minute, int second, int nanos)
```

- Finally, we can combine dates and times:
```
LocalDateTime dateTime1 = LocalDateTime.of(2015, Month.JANUARY, 20, 6, 15, 30);
LocalDateTime dateTime2 = LocalDateTime.of(date1, time1);
```

- The first line of code shows how you can specify all the information about the LocalDateTime right in the same line. There are many method signatures allowing you to specify different things. Having that many numbers in a row gets to be hard to read, though. The second line of code shows how you can create LocalDate and LocalTime objects separately first and then combine them to create a LocalDateTime object.

- This time there are a lot of method signatures since there are more combinations. The method signatures are as follows:
```
public static LocalDateTime of(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minute)
public static LocalDateTime of(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minute, int second)
public static LocalDateTime of(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minute, int second, int nanos)
public static LocalDateTime of(int year, Month month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minute)
public static LocalDateTime of(int year, Month month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minute, int second)
public static LocalDateTime of(int year, Month month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minute, int second, int nanos)
public static LocalDateTime of(LocalDate date, LocalTime)
```

- Did you notice that we did not use a constructor in any of the examples? The date and time classes have private constructors to force you to use the static methods. The exam creators may try to throw something like this at you:
```
LocalDate d = new LocalDate(); // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

- Don’t fall for this. You are not allowed to construct a date or time object directly. Another trick is to see what happens when you pass invalid numbers to of(). For example:
```
LocalDate.of(2015, Month.JANUARY, 32) // throws DateTimeException
```

- You don’t need to know the exact exception that’s thrown, but it’s a clear one:
```
java.time.DateTimeException: Invalid value for DayOfMonth
 (valid values 1 - 28/31): 32
```

- __Creating Dates in Java 7 and Earlier__: You can see some of the problems with the “old way” in the following table. There wasn’t a way to specify just a date without the time. The Date class represented both the date and time whether you wanted it to or not. Trying to create a specific date required more code than it should have. Month indexes were 0 based instead of 1 based, which was confusing. There’s an old way to create a date. In Java 1.1, you created a specific Date with this: Date jan = new Date(2015, Calendar.JANUARY, 1);. You could use the Calendar class beginning with Java 1.2. Date exists mainly for backward compatibility and so that Calendar can work with code—making the “new way” the third way. The “new way” is much better so it looks like this is a case of the third time is the charm!

# Manipulating Dates and Times

- Adding to a date is easy. The date and time classes are immutable, just like String was. This means that we need to remember to assign the results of these methods to a reference variable so they are not lost.
```
12: LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2014, Month.JANUARY, 20);
13: System.out.println(date); // 2014-01-20
14: date = date.plusDays(2);
15: System.out.println(date); // 2014-01-22
16: date = date.plusWeeks(1);
17: System.out.println(date); // 2014-01-29
18: date = date.plusMonths(1);
19: System.out.println(date); // 2014-02-28
20: date = date.plusYears(5);
21: System.out.println(date); // 2019-02-28
```

- There are also nice easy methods to go backward in time. This time, let’s work with LocalDateTime.
```
22: LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2020, Month.JANUARY, 20);
23: LocalTime time = LocalTime.of(5, 15);
24: LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(date, time);
25: System.out.println(dateTime); // 2020-01-20T05:15
26: dateTime = dateTime.minusDays(1);
27: System.out.println(dateTime); // 2020-01-19T05:15
28: dateTime = dateTime.minusHours(10);
29: System.out.println(dateTime); // 2020-01-18T19:15
30: dateTime = dateTime.minusSeconds(30);
31: System.out.println(dateTime); // 2020-01-18T19:14:30
```

- It is common for date and time methods to be chained. For example, without the print statements, the previous example could be rewritten as follows:
```
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2020, Month.JANUARY, 20);
LocalTime time = LocalTime.of(5, 15);
LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(date2, time).minusDays(1).minusHours(10).minusSeconds(30);
```

- When you have a lot of manipulations to make, this chaining comes in handy. There are two ways the exam creators can try to trick you. What do you think this prints?
```
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2020, Month.JANUARY, 20);
date.plusDays(10);
System.out.println(date);
```

- It prints January 20, 2020. Adding 10 days was useless because we ignored the result. Whenever you see immutable types, pay attention to make sure the return value of a method call isn’t ignored.

- The exam also may test to see if you remember what each of the date and time objects includes. Do you see what is wrong here?
```
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2020, Month.JANUARY, 20);
date = date.plusMinutes(1); // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

- LocalDate does not contain time. This means you cannot add minutes to it. This can be tricky in a chained sequence of additions/subtraction operations, so make sure you know which methods in Table below can be called on which of the three objects.

- __Manipulating Dates in Java 7 and Earlier__: As you look at all the code in the following table to do time calculations in the “old way,” you can see why Java needed to revamp the date and time APIs! The “old way” took a lot of code to do something simple.
