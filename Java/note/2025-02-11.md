# Public Access

```
package pond.duck;
public class DuckTeacher {
 public String name = "helpful"; // public access
 public void swim() { // public access
  System.out.println("swim");
 } }
```

- DuckTeacher allows access to any class that wants it. Now we can try it out:

```
package pond.goose;
import pond.duck.DuckTeacher;
public class LostDuckling {
 public void swim() {
  DuckTeacher teacher = new DuckTeacher();
  teacher.swim(); // allowed
  System.out.println("Thanks" + teacher.name); // allowed
 } }
```

- LostDuckling is able to refer to swim() and name on DuckTeacher because they are public. The story has a happy ending. LostDuckling has learned to swim and can find its parents—all because DuckTeacher made them public.

- To review access modifiers, make sure you know why everything in Table below is true. Remember that a member is a method or field.

| Access Level                                   | Member in the Same Class | Member in Another Class in Same Package | Member in a Superclass in a Different Package | Method/Field in a Nonsuperclass Class in a Different Package |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| If that member is private?                     | Yes                      | No                                     | No                                             | No                                                            |
| If that member has default (package private) access? | Yes                      | Yes                                    | No                                             | No                                                            |
| If that member is protected?                   | Yes                      | Yes                                    | Yes                                            | No                                                            |
| If that member is public?                      | Yes                      | Yes                                    | Yes                                            | Yes                                                           |

# Designing Static Methods and Fields

- Except for the main() method, we’ve been looking at instance methods. Static methods don’t require an instance of the class. They are shared among all users of the class. You can think of statics as being a member of the single class object that exist independently of any instances of that class.

# Does Each Class Have Its Own Copy of the Code?

- Each class has a copy of the instance variables. There is only one copy of the code for the instance methods. Each instance of the class can call it as many times as it would like. However, each call of an instance method (or any method) gets space on the stack for method parameters and local variables.

- The same thing happens for static methods. There is one copy of the code. Parameters and local variables go on the stack.

- Just remember that only data gets its “own copy.” There is no need to duplicate copies of the code itself.

- We have seen one static method since Chapter 1. The main() method is a static method. That means you can call it by the classname.

```
public class Koala {
 public static int count = 0; // static variable
 public static void main(String[] args) { // static method
  System.out.println(count);
 }
}
```

- We said that the JVM basically calls Koala.main() to get the program started. You can do this too. We can have a KoalaTester that does nothing but call the main() method.

```
public class KoalaTester {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  Koala.main(new String[0]); // call static method
 }
}
```

- Quite a complicated way to print 0, isn’t it? When we run KoalaTester, it makes a call to the main() method of Koala, which prints the value of count. The purpose of all these examples is to show that main() can be called just like any other static method.

- In addition to main() methods, static methods have two main purposes:
   - For utility or helper methods that don’t require any object state. Since there is no need to access instance variables, having static methods eliminates the need for the caller to instantiate the object just to call the method.
   - For state that is shared by all instances of a class, like a counter. All instances must share the same state. Methods that merely use that state should be static as well.
