- A Java *operator* is a special symbol that can be applied to a set of variables, values, or literals—referred to as operands—and that returns a result. Three fl avors of operators are available in Java: unary, binary, and ternary. These types of operators can be applied to one, two, or three operands, respectively. For the OCA exam, you’ll need know a specific subset of Java operators, how to apply them, and the order in which they should be applied.

- Java operators are not necessarily evaluated from left-to-right order. For example, the following Java expression is actually evaluated from right-to-left given the specifi c operators involved:
```
int y = 4;
double x = 3 + 2 * --y;
```

- Unless overridden with parentheses, Java operators follow order of operation, listed in Table below, by decreasing order of operator precedence. If two operators have the same level of precedence, then Java guarantees left-to-right evaluation. You need to know only those operators in bold for the OCA exam.

- __Arithmetic Operators__: *Arithmetic operators* are often encountered in early mathematics and include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and modulus (%). They also include the unary operators, ++ and --. As you may have noticed in Table above, the multiplicative operators (\*, /, %) have a higher order of precedence than the additive operators (+, -). 

- Notice that we said “Unless overridden with parentheses…” prior to Table above. That’s because you can change the order of operation explicitly by wrapping parentheses around the sections you want evaluated first.

- All of the arithmetic operators may be applied to any Java primitives, except boolean and String. Furthermore, only the addition operators + and += may be applied to String values, which results in String concatenation.

- Although we are sure you have seen most of the arithmetic operators before, the modulus operator, %, may be new to you. The modulus, or remainder operator, is simply the remainder when two numbers are divided.

- Be sure to understand the difference between arithmetic division and modulus. For integer values, division results in the fl oor value of the nearest integer that fulfills the operation, whereas modulus is the remainder value. The following examples illustrate this distinction:
```
System.out.print(9 / 3); // Outputs 3
System.out.print(9 % 3); // Outputs 0

System.out.print(10 / 3); // Outputs 3
System.out.print(10 % 3); // Outputs 1

System.out.print(11 / 3); // Outputs 3
System.out.print(11 % 3); // Outputs 2

System.out.print(12 / 3); // Outputs 4
System.out.print(12 % 3); // Outputs 0
```

- __Note__: The modulus operation is not limited to positive integer values in Java and may also be applied to negative integers and floating-point integers. For a given divisor y and negative dividend, the resulting modulus value is between and (-y + 1) and 0. For the OCA exam, though, you are not required to be able to take the modulus of a negative integer or a floating point number.
