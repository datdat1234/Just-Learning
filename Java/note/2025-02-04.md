13. F (This is a trick question. The first line does not compile because you cannot assign a String to a StringBuilder. If that line were StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder("rumble"), the code would compile and print rum4. Watch out for this sort of trick on the exam. You could easily spend a minute working out the character positions for no reason at all.)
14. A C
15. C E F (Option C uses the variable name as if it were a type, which is clearly illegal. Options E and F don’t specify any size. Although it is legal to leave out the size for later dimensions of a multidimensional array, the first one is required. Option A declares a legal 2D array. Option B declares a legal 3D array. Option D declares a legal 2D array. Remember that it is normal to see on the exam types you might not have learned. You aren’t expected to know anything about them.)
16. C
17. F
18. A C D E (An array is not able to change size and can have multiple dimensions. Both an array and ArrayList are ordered and have indexes. Neither is immutable. The elements can change in value.)
19. B C (An array does not override equals() and so uses object equality. ArrayList does override equals() and defines it as the same elements in the same order. The compiler does not know when an index is out of bounds and thus can’t give you a compiler error. The code will throw an exception at runtime, though.)
