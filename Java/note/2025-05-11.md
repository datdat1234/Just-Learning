### hashCode

Whenever you override equals(), you are also expected to override hashCode(). The hash code is used when storing the object as a key in a map.

A hash code is a number that puts instances of a class into a finite number of categories. Imagine that I gave you a deck of cards, and I told you that I was going to ask you for specific cards and I want to get the right card back quickly. You have as long as you want to prepare, but I’m in a big hurry when I start asking for cards. You might make 13 piles of cards: All of the aces in one pile, all the twos in another pile, and so forth. That way, when I ask for the five of hearts, you can just pull the right card out of the four cards in the pile with fives. It is certainly faster than going through the whole deck of 52 cards! You could even make 52 piles if you had enough space on the table.

What do you do if you have a primitive and need the hash code? The hash code is just a number. On the exam, you can just use a primitive number as is or divide to get a smaller int. Remember that all of the instance variables don’t need to be used in a hashCode() method. It is common not to include boolean and char variables in the hash code.

The official JavaDoc contract for hashCode() is harder to read than it needs to be. The three points in the contract boil down to these:
   - Within the same program, the result of hashCode() must not change. This means that you shouldn’t include variables that change in figuring out the hash code. In our hippo example, including the name is fine. Including the weight is not because hippos change weight regularly.
   - If equals() returns true when called with two objects, calling hashCode() on each of those objects must return the same result. This means hashCode() can use a subset of the variables that equals() uses. You saw this in the card example. We used only one of the variables to determine the hash code.
   - If equals() returns false when called with two objects, calling hashCode() on each of those objects does not have to return a different result. This means hashCode() results do not need to be unique when called on unequal objects.
