7. B, C, D, F. The two classes are in different packages, which means private access and default (package private) access will not compile. Additionally, protected access will not compile since School does not inherit from Classroom. Therefore, only line 8 will compile because it uses public access.
8. B C E
9. C, E. Option A is incorrect because the property is of type boolean and getters must begin with is for booleans. Options B and D are incorrect because they donâ€™t follow the naming convention of beginning with get/is/set. Options C and E follow normal getter and setter conventions.
10. B
11. B, E. Line 10 does not compile because static methods are not allowed to call instance methods. Even though we are calling play() as if it were an instance method and an instance exists, Java knows play() is really a static method and treats it as such. If line 10 is removed, the code works. It does not throw a NullPointerException on line 16 because play() is a static method. Java looks at the type of the reference for rope2 and translates the call to Rope.play().
12. D. There are two details to notice in this code. First, note that RopeSwing has an instance initializer and not a static initializer. Since RopeSwing is never constructed, the instance initializer does not run. The other detail is that length is static. Changes from one object update this common static variable.
