1. G (String concatenation)
2. A C D (The String Pool)
3. B C E
4. B
5. F (The question is trying to distract you into paying attention to logical equality versus object reference equality. It is hoping you will miss the fact that line 4 does not compile. Java does not allow you to compare String and StringBuilder using ==.)
6. B
7. B D E
8. A D E
9. C
10. F (a += 2 expands to a = a + 2. A String concatenated with any other type gives a String. Lines 14, 15, and 16 all append to a, giving a result of "2cfalse". The if statement on line 18 returns false because the values of the two String objects are the same using object equality. The if statement on line 17 returns false because the two String objects are not the same in memory. One comes directly from the string pool and the other comes from building using String operations.)
