# RAM Introduction

RAM stand for Random Access Memory, and the amount of RAM you buy will determine how much temporary data you can store for near-instant access. It allows you to switch between different programs or tabs quickly. For example, if you had a lot of tabs open in Chrome, more RAM would allow you to switch between tabs without having to reload a page each time you switched back to it.
