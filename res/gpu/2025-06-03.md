# Graphics Card Introduction

The graphics card (also called the GPU or Graphics Processing Unit) generates the images you see on your screen. Typically, graphics cards are only needed by people building a PC with the intent to run games or graphical design software, although some people use lower-end graphics cards in conjunction with CPUs that donâ€™t have integrated graphics. A better graphics card usually translates to higher framerates when running games.
