# Case Introduction

The case is the part of the computer you see. Sometimes called the tower, it comes in three main sizes: Full tower, Mid tower, and Mini tower. Unless you need to store your computer in a very small compartment, Mid or Full towers are the best option, since if you get anything smaller, you will probably need to get a significantly downsized motherboard. The case holds all of the components inside, and is the hub to which you connect almost all external cables (display cables like HDMI and DisplayPort, USB connectors, Ethernet cables, and more).
