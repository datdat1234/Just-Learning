# Storage Drive Introduction

The storage drive(s) in your computer are what determine its storage capacity. There are two main types of drive: HDD and SSD. Furthermore, the SSD category is broken into 2 types of its own: NVMe and SATA.
   - __HDD:__ HDD stands for Hard Disk Drive, and has been around for longer than the SSD. As mentioned above, hard drives are more cost-efficient but not as fast at data retrieval.
   - __SSD:__ SSD stands for Solid State Drive, the more recently-developed storage drive. SSD’s retrieve information much faster, making them highly desirable. This means your system will also boot faster when using an SSD. The downside of this is that they cost a bit more per gigabyte of storage, so it isn’t always feasible to have an SSD if you’re on a budget.
      - NVMe: NVMe stands for Non-Volatile Memory Express. This type of SSD is the fastest money can buy, more than 5 times faster than most SATA SSDs (more on those in a minute). This means that data is transferred to and from the drive much quicker than even a standard SSD, but as a result they cost more.
      - SATA: SATA stands for Serial Advanced Technology Attachment, and refers to the motherboard port that SATA SSDs plug into. These SSDs are slower than their NVMe counterparts, but still much faster than traditional hard drives.
