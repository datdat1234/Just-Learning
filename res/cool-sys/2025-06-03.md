# CPU Cooling System Introduction

The cooler keeps your CPU’s temperature in a safe range. Many processors come with a base-level cooling system which will suffice for many builds. If you have a high-powered processor with high clockspeeds, however, you may want to invest in a higher-quality CPU cooler. Thermal paste applied between the cooler and CPU helps the cooler remove heat from the CPU and keep it from overheating.

Unless you plan to overclock your CPU (boost the speed it runs at to get better performance from it), the default cooler that comes with your processor should be more than adequate. For this reason, I won’t cover the process of picking a CPU cooler in this guide, but if you decide you want to buy an aftermarket cooler here’s a list of some excellent choices. It’s also worth noting that some higher-end processors don’t come with a cooler, so make sure to check before you order so you can get one if necessary.
